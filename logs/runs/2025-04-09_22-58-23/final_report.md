# Tariffs Summary Report

## Overview of Current Tariffs by Country
The "World Tariff Profiles 2024" report, co-published by the World Trade Organization (WTO), International Trade Centre, and UNCTAD, provides a comprehensive overview of tariffs and non-tariff measures (NTMs) from over 170 countries and customs territories. This report details average "bound" tariffs (the maximum tariffs allowed) and actual applied tariffs across agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. Each economy is profiled with specific tariff data categorized by product groups according to the WTO's Multilateral Trade Negotiations (MTN) Categories.

A notable focus of this edition is on tariffs related to critical minerals essential for electric vehicle (EV) production, including cobalt, graphite, and lithium. Additionally, it presents statistics on NTMs, such as anti-dumping and safeguard measures, offering a holistic view of trade barriers. The report aims to assist countries in understanding trade dynamics and formulating effective economic policies.

## Historical Tariff Trends and Changes
Recent research highlights the evolving role of tariffs in U.S. economic policy, particularly under the Trump administration's proposals for 2025. Key observations include:

1. **Current Tariff Landscape**: The U.S. has enacted significant tariffs, including a 10% tariff on Chinese goods and proposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, creating market uncertainty and increasing costs for businesses and consumers.

2. **Historical Context**: Tariffs, once a major source of federal revenue, have seen their contribution diminish over the past century. The recent tariff measures indicate a shift back toward protectionism, contrasting with the trade liberalization trends of recent decades.

3. **Economic Impact**: Proposed tariffs could elevate the average effective tariff rate (AETR) to as high as 17%, disproportionately affecting manufacturing sectors reliant on imports from China, Canada, and Mexico.

4. **Sector-Specific Effects**: Industries such as transportation equipment, fabricated metals, and textiles are expected to bear the brunt of these tariffs, while agriculture and energy sectors may experience less impact.

5. **Regional Disparities**: The economic effects of tariffs will vary across U.S. regions, with manufacturing-heavy areas, particularly in the Midwest and South, likely to face significant disruptions and job losses.

6. **Business Concerns**: A substantial percentage of firms, especially in manufacturing, express growing concerns about tariffs, prompting many to diversify supply chains and reduce hiring due to uncertainty.

7. **Long-Term Considerations**: Policymakers are encouraged to balance the potential economic costs of tariffs against their intended benefits, considering targeted support for adversely affected industries and communities.

Overall, these findings underscore the complex implications of tariffs on the U.S. economy, highlighting the need for careful policy considerations to mitigate negative impacts while pursuing trade objectives.

## Key Factors Influencing Tariff Rates
The Richmond Fed's April 2025 Economic Brief analyzes the economic impact of proposed tariffs, revealing significant increases in the AETR. In 2024, the AETR was 2.2%, but with the introduction of new tariffs—20% on Chinese imports, 25% on aluminum and steel, and additional tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and the EU—the AETR could rise to as high as 17.0% under aggressive scenarios.

Key findings include:
- The AETR increases to 7.1% with initial tariffs, and further to 10.4% with additional tariffs on Canada and Mexico.
- The automotive sector faces particularly high tariff burdens, with AETRs reaching 20.1% for Mexico and 14.1% for Canada.
- Manufacturing sectors reliant on imports, especially fabricated metals and transportation equipment, could see average tariff rates exceeding 30%.
- The tariffs are expected to raise consumer costs and disrupt supply chains, potentially leading to job losses in industries heavily dependent on imported inputs.
- Over 30% of firms surveyed identified trade and tariffs as their most pressing concern, with many planning to diversify supply chains and reduce hiring in response to uncertainties.

This analysis emphasizes the need for policymakers to consider the broader economic implications of tariffs, particularly their potential to increase consumer prices and disrupt local economies, especially in manufacturing-intensive regions.

## Impact of Tariffs on International Trade
On April 2, 2023, the U.S. Administration announced significant tariff increases, signaling a return to protectionist policies reminiscent of the Great Depression. This shift is expected to have widespread implications for the global economy, with varying impacts across different countries and sectors.

Key findings from the research include:

1. **Severity of Tariffs**: The newly imposed tariffs are more severe than anticipated, leading to a substantial downgrade in growth forecasts for both the U.S. and global economies. While a recession may be avoided, world trade volumes are expected to decline significantly.

2. **Varied Global Impact**:
   - **China**: Faces significant challenges, likely prompting fiscal responses that may not fully mitigate negative economic effects.
   - **Eurozone**: Anticipated GDP growth reduction of 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points, with potential retaliatory measures affecting investment.
   - **UK**: Growth forecast downgraded to below 1% due to weakened demand and trade policy uncertainty.
   - **Asia-Pacific**: Countries like Vietnam, South Korea, and Taiwan are particularly vulnerable, while India and the Philippines may be better insulated.
   - **Latin America**: Generally less affected due to lower reliance on U.S. exports, but still facing significant growth impacts.

3. **Sector-Specific Consequences**: The tariffs will dampen sentiment across various industries, particularly those reliant on trade. While a global recession might be avoided, the economic fallout could still be severe.

4. **Practical Implications for Businesses**: Companies should prepare for increased uncertainty and potential shifts in market dynamics, emphasizing the need for strategic planning and risk management.

In conclusion, the research highlights the complex and multifaceted impacts of the new tariffs on global trade and economic performance, urging businesses and policymakers to adapt to this evolving landscape.
