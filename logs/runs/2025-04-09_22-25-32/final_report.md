# Financial Research Summary

## Task 1: Research the economic impact of tariffs on specific industries

The research from the Richmond Fed, published in April 2025, analyzes the economic impact of proposed tariffs set to take effect in 2025. Key findings include:

1. **Average Effective Tariff Rate (AETR)**: The AETR is projected to rise significantly from 2.2% in 2024 to 17.0% under the most aggressive tariff scenario, which includes a 25% tariff on all imports from the EU and additional tariffs on imports from China, Canada, and Mexico.

2. **Sectoral Impact**: Industries heavily reliant on imports, particularly manufacturing sectors like transportation equipment and fabricated metals, will face the highest tariff burdens. For instance, fabricated metal products could see average tariffs exceeding 30%.

3. **Regional Disparities**: The impact of tariffs will vary by region, with counties in the Midwest and South, particularly those involved in automotive manufacturing, experiencing the most significant increases in tariff exposure.

4. **Consumer and Business Effects**: The tariffs are expected to raise import costs, leading to higher consumer prices and potential disruptions in supply chains. Over 30% of surveyed firms identified trade and tariffs as their top business concern, indicating heightened sensitivity to these changes.

5. **Global Implications**: The tariffs are anticipated to have varied effects globally, with countries like China, the Eurozone, and certain Asia-Pacific nations facing significant challenges due to their trade dependencies on the U.S. Conversely, some countries may be less affected.

6. **Employment Concerns**: Many firms are planning to adjust their hiring and investment strategies in response to the uncertainty surrounding tariffs, with a notable percentage of manufacturing firms expecting to reduce hiring.

Overall, the proposed tariffs could lead to substantial economic disruptions, raising costs for consumers and businesses while potentially benefiting certain protected industries. Policymakers are urged to consider the broader economic implications and support affected communities.

## Task 2: Identify sectors that typically benefit from increased tariffs

On March 4, 2025, the U.S. announced new tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, which could create opportunities for certain domestic industries while raising costs for consumers. Key findings from the analysis include:

1. **Beneficial Industries**:
   - **Domestic Manufacturing & Industrials**: Companies like Caterpillar (CAT) and Nucor Corporation (NUE) may benefit from reduced foreign competition and increased demand for U.S.-made goods.
   - **Energy Sector**: U.S. oil companies such as ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) could gain from tariffs on imported energy, making domestic production more competitive.
   - **Agriculture**: U.S. food producers like Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) may see increased demand as tariffs raise prices on imported agricultural products.
   - **Technology**: U.S. semiconductor firms like Intel (INTC) could benefit from government incentives aimed at reshoring production.

2. **Investment Opportunities**: Financial professionals can explore ETFs focused on sectors poised to benefit from tariffs, such as the Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLI) and the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE).

3. **Economic Impact**: While tariffs can protect certain industries, they may lead to higher consumer prices and potential job losses in sectors reliant on imported materials. For example, tariffs on steel have been linked to job losses in manufacturing due to increased production costs.

4. **Market Volatility**: Tariffs could influence GDP growth and market volatility, necessitating careful monitoring by financial advisors to adjust investment strategies accordingly.

5. **Long-term Considerations**: While tariffs may provide short-term benefits to specific sectors, they can also lead to inefficiencies and higher prices for consumers, raising concerns about overall economic health.

In conclusion, while new tariffs may create opportunities for some U.S. industries, they also pose risks to consumers and the broader economy, highlighting the need for balanced trade policies.

## Task 3: Find stocks of companies that are likely to thrive in a tariff-implemented environment

The research identifies seven stocks poised to benefit from potential tariff policies under a Donald Trump presidency in 2025. These stocks are expected to rally due to their respective industries' positioning and market dynamics influenced by tariffs. The highlighted companies are:

1. **Nucor (NUE)**: A steel manufacturer likely to benefit from tariffs on imported steel, with a target price suggesting a 27% upside.
2. **Trex (TREX)**: A leader in wood-alternative decking, expected to gain from rising lumber prices due to tariffs, with a target price indicating a 16% upside.
3. **Carpenter Technology (CRS)**: A specialty materials company involved in 3D printing, benefiting from shortened supply chains, despite recent earnings misses.
4. **Carvana (CVNA)**: An e-commerce platform for used cars, capitalizing on high new car prices and expected growth in the used car market.
5. **General Motors (GM)**: Positioned to benefit from tariffs protecting U.S. automakers, with a focus on trucks and electric vehicles, showing a 15% upside potential.
6. **Intel (INTC)**: A semiconductor company that may gain from domestic manufacturing incentives, despite recent stock declines.
7. **Coinbase (COIN)**: A cryptocurrency exchange likely to benefit from increased interest in Bitcoin amid economic uncertainty, with a modest upside.

The report emphasizes that while these stocks may attract traders looking for short-term gains, long-term investors should consider their cyclical nature and the broader economic context.

## Task 4: Analyze historical data on stock performance during previous tariff implementations

The research by Kristina Bratanova-Cvetanova analyzes the potential impacts of new tariffs on financial markets, drawing from historical data on previous tariffs. Key findings include:

1. **Historical Context**: Past tariffs, such as those imposed in 2018 on solar panels, washing machines, steel, and aluminum, had minimal effects on broad equity, bond, or volatility indices. Market movements were often influenced more by macroeconomic news than by the tariffs themselves.

2. **Sector-Specific Impacts**:
   - **Solar Tariffs**: A 30% tariff on solar panel components led to a 9% drop in the China Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment index within the first month, with significant losses for leading companies.
   - **Washing Machine Tariffs**: A 50% tariff resulted in a 5-7% decline in stock prices for major exporters in the first month.
   - **Steel and Aluminum Tariffs**: A 25% tariff on steel and a 10% tariff on aluminum caused a 5% drop in broad industrial indices in the first month.

3. **U.S.-China Trade War**: During the trade war period from January to June 2018, U.S. equity indices dropped by 4%, while Chinese indices fell by 13%. Currency depreciation was also noted, with the Chinese Renminbi losing value against the U.S. dollar.

4. **Hypothetical Scenarios**: The analysis predicts that new tariffs could lead to:
   - A 5% drop in the value of the affected equity industry within the first month.
   - A 10-15% loss in stock values for leading companies directly impacted by tariffs.
   - A moderate 2% drop in broader equity markets from hypothetical tariffs on auto parts from Mexico.

5. **Long-Term Tariff Effects**: The study suggests that longer-term tariffs, especially those involving retaliation, could lead to more substantial declines in equity indices and currency values.

6. **Conclusion**: The research emphasizes that while tariffs can have immediate impacts on specific sectors, broader market effects are often muted and influenced by other economic factors. Policymakers should consider the potential disruptions and costs associated with new tariffs, particularly in manufacturing and trade-dependent regions. 

Overall, the findings highlight the complex interplay between tariffs, market responses, and economic conditions, suggesting that careful consideration is needed when implementing trade policies.
