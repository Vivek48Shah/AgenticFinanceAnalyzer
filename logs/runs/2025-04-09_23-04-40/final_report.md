# Report on U.S. Tariffs Imposed on Various Countries

## Summary of Tariffs Imposed by the USA

On April 2, 2025, President Donald Trump announced a series of substantial tariffs on imports from over 60 countries, citing a $1.2 trillion trade imbalance as the primary justification. The new tariff regime includes a baseline rate of 10% on all imports, with significantly higher rates imposed on specific countries: 34% on China, 20% on the European Union, and even steeper rates of 49% on Cambodia and 46% on Vietnam. This initiative, dubbed "Liberation Day," has raised concerns among economists regarding potential inflation and economic slowdown, both domestically and globally. The tariffs are scheduled to be implemented in stages, with the baseline rate commencing on April 5 and reciprocal tariffs following on April 9. The announcement has sparked fears of retaliatory tariffs from affected nations, particularly China, which has indicated plans to respond with its own tariffs on U.S. goods.

## Country Facing the Highest Tariffs

According to the 2024 World Population Review, while the U.S. has historically maintained low tariff rates, it has recently imposed some of the highest tariffs on specific countries. As of 2024, Bermuda holds the highest average tariff rate globally at 23.8%, followed by the Cayman Islands at 20.4% and Belize at 17.8%. In contrast, the U.S. has one of the lowest average tariff rates at approximately 1.5%. However, the recent tariffs announced by the Trump administration have significantly altered the landscape, particularly for countries like China, which faces a 34% tariff, making it one of the most affected nations.

## Historical Changes in U.S. Tariffs

An analysis of U.S. tariff rates from 1989 to 2025 reveals a long-term trend of declining tariffs, with the weighted mean applied tariff rate dropping from 13.78% in 2019 to 1.47% in 2021. This decline reflects a broader shift towards free trade agreements among industrialized nations. However, the recent political climate, particularly under the Trump administration, has seen a resurgence in protectionist measures, reversing years of gradual tariff reductions. The historical context indicates that tariffs were once a significant source of government revenue but have increasingly been used as tools for trade negotiation and protectionism, leading to heightened tensions with trading partners, especially China.

## Expert Analyses on the Impact of Tariffs

Recent analyses underscore the profound economic implications of the newly imposed tariffs, which are reminiscent of protectionist policies not seen since the Great Depression. Key findings include:

1. **Economic Impact**: The tariffs are projected to downgrade growth forecasts for both the U.S. and global economies, with potential declines in world trade volumes affecting economic performance through 2025 and beyond.
   
2. **Varied Global Effects**: Different regions will experience disparate impacts; for instance, China may face significant economic challenges, while the Eurozone could see GDP growth reduced by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points.

3. **Sector-Specific Consequences**: Industries reliant on trade may experience job losses and dampened sentiment due to the tariffs.

4. **Consumer Prices**: The tariffs are expected to increase consumer prices, disproportionately affecting lower-income households as they act as a tax on imports.

5. **Trade Policy Uncertainty**: The uncertainty surrounding trade policies is likely to hinder business investment and consumer confidence, complicating economic recovery efforts.

6. **Long-Term Considerations**: The tariffs could strengthen the U.S. dollar, negatively impacting exporters, while retaliatory measures from other countries may exacerbate trade tensions and lead to broader economic slowdowns.

In conclusion, while the U.S. tariffs aim to protect domestic industries, they pose significant risks to both the U.S. and global economies, necessitating careful consideration by policymakers and businesses alike.
