# AgenticFinanceAnalyser

> An intelligent, autonomous financial analysis system powered by agentic AI and LLMs — combining search, reasoning, and report synthesis to emulate a multi-agent financial research team.

AgenticFinanceAnalyser orchestrates a group of autonomous agents to perform end-to-end financial research. The system decomposes a user query into discrete search objectives, retrieves and extracts high-quality information from the web using Tavily, filters and cleans noisy content, and finally synthesizes insights using OpenAI’s GPT-4o.

Each stage is handled by a specialized agent — a planner, multiple researcher/cleaner/summarizer agents, and a final synthesizer — coordinated by LangGraph's agentic control flow.

##  Agentic Architecture

This system is structured like a team of AI-powered financial researchers:

| Agent Role         | Responsibility                                                   |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧭 Planner Agent    | Decomposes the user query into 2–4 actionable search subtasks     |
| 🔍 Research Agents  | Perform Tavily search + extract content for each task            |
| 🧼 Cleaner Agent     | Removes marketing boilerplate, social media prompts, footers     |
| 🧠 Summarizer Agent | Condenses each task’s findings using GPT-4o                      |
| 🧾 Synthesizer Agent | Compiles structured final report with section-wise analysis      |

All agents communicate via LangGraph’s evolving state, enabling seamless multi-step research flows.
